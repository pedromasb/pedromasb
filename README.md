### Hi all! 👋

I'm a PhD student in Astrophysics & Data Science based in Madrid, Spain. For my PhD I'm working on the application of machine and deep learning 
techniques to large astronomical surveys. Previously, I worked as a Business Intelligence developer & consultant for an international IT consulting firm, 
where I was focused on data modelling and dashboard development with Qlik Sense. I'm a big fan of data visualisation and delving into 
topics such as sports and meteorology in my personal projects. 

Outside the office, you can find me playing soccer ⚽ or listening to music 🎶.
